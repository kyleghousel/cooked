# Cooked: Recipe Generator
 User can select a cuisine to cook a random recipe from, or be given a completley random recipe using themealdb free API.
 This is my first project using React, Tailwind CSS, and Fetch API.

###Still need to do:
- Add vegetarian and seafood dietary qualifiers that will filter results
- Edit footer
- Set size min/max limits for certain UI elements
- Create load state
- Handle error states for failed requests?
